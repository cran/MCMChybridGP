Description: Hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to simulate from a
        multimodal target distribution.  A Gaussian process
        approximation makes this possible when derivatives are unknown.
        The Package serves to minimize the number of function
        evaluations in Bayesian calibration of computer models using
        parallel tempering.  It allows replacement of the true target
        distribution in high temperature chains, or complete replacement
        of the target.  Methods used are described in, "Efficient MCMC
        schemes for computationally expensive posterior distributions",
        Fielding et al. (2011) <doi:10.1198/TECH.2010.09195>.

        Multi-Reservoir Management research programme (R-264-001-272).
